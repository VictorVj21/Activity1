1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2


(i)HTTP1.1 works on the textual format while HTTP2 works on the binary protocol.
(ii)In HTTP1.1 there is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it 
doesn’t get its all resources while HTTP2  allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
(iii)HTTP1.1 uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages while HTTP2 uses 
PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
(iv)HTTP 1.1 compresses data by itself while HTTP2 uses HPACK for data compression.
(v)HTTP1.1 is relatively secure since it uses digest authentication, NTLM authentication while
HTTP2 is better equipped to deal with them due to new TLS features like connection error of type Inadequate_Security.
(vi)However HTTP2  has advantages over HTTP1.1 over the following areas:
*Protocol negotiation mechanism — protocol electing
*High-level compatibility with HTTP/1.1 — methods, status codes, URIs and header fields.
*Page load speed improvements trough:
*Compression of request headers
*Binary protocol
*HTTP/2 Server Push
*Request multiplexing over a single TCP connection
*Request pipelining
*HOL blocking (Head-of-line) — Package blocking





2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


(i)Objects are important data types in javascript.
(ii)Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 
(iii)Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 
(iv)These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
(v)Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

For example;
var myPhone = new Object();
myPhone.make = 'Redmi';
myPhone.model = '8';
myPhone.year = 2018;
myCar.battery = 5000mAh;

After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.

i.e.

myPhone.year

Output: 2018

These values can be accessed using brackets notation also.

myCar[year]

Output: 2018

The syntax for adding a property to an object is :
ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;
The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:
delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;
The syntax to access a property from an object is:
objectName.property (or) objectName["property”] (or) objectName[expression]   
So, conclusion and simple definition for Java Script properties is “Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”.


Object methods
An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

i.e.,

Let’s assume to start the phone there will be a mechanical functionality.
function(){return powerButton.on}

and so similar is to volume up/down , etc.
So, conclusion and simple definition for Java Script Object methods is “Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.”
